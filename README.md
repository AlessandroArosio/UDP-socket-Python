# UDP-socket-Python
UDP server and client - Python

Yet another Computer Networking exercise (Birkbeck University of London) showing an UDP server-client program in Python.
The server creates a socket and listen for all the incoming connections.
The client sends a message in an UDP datagram packet to the server, then it convers the received string to upper case and send back to the client.
